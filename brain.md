# Sciences about Brain

### Where am I?
- End of section 9
    - Finish here, since I think I got what I need
### Takeaways
- Theory with a few experimental groundings supports the idea of grid cell / place cell(-like) system is a unit of intelligence in neocortex column
    - grid cell is unit of "where", while place cell provides "what"
- Author proposes that grid cell / place cell system with some kind of "concept space" could explain intelligence will be the backbone of all kinds of intelligence (like how to understand "concept of democracy")
- Out of multiple possible candidates, we percept "voted" concept
    - consistent with;
        - Saccade doesn't disrupt vision
        - Optical illusion like Rubin's vase
- Traditional hierachical feature extraction theory doesn't explain much of "vision in normal world"
    - the author instead proposes "hierachical object theory", in which all the neocortex region contains object level information, while deeper layer like V5 contains more sophisticated object
- "Artificial General Intelligence should follow brain's steps"
### Questions & Comments
- Looks like reasonable for "the reason behind reasoning"
    - Like described fMRI experiment in which the subjects imagine new type of bird, when (explicitly or implicitly) he/she should extract the features of existing birds to combine with something as a plus (to make it new type)
- Supporting evidence for the intelligence except for visonary system looks weak to me, but let's see what happens or try to find something by myself
- What about human inspiration?
    - Sometimes (like when the author came up with this fascinating theory) we combine something which seems way different - could it be explained by this theory?
- Totally agree that hierachical feature extraction theory for vision system is not the only framework for vision, although it should explain much in lab experiment settings
    - Not sure if this is the only explanation, but "hierachical object theory" sounds promising
- Does "voting" explain visual superiority - what seems to be hierachy among perception type?
    - Or is there "weighted voting"?
